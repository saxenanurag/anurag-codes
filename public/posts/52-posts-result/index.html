          <p>At the end of 2017, I decided to make blogging a part of my life of 2018. I decided that I will be writing 52 posts, which is a post a week. And hence, <strong>52 posts in 52 weeks</strong> was born.</p>
<p>It’s the end of 2018 and I published <strong>18 posts</strong> (not counting this post). 18 is less than 52, but better than 0.</p>
<p>The year started off with a post a week, but I quickly fell behind. Part of the reason was motivation, the other is that writing is hard. During this process, I realized that in order to write more, I have to read more. So I started reading more.</p>
<p>I have given up on blogging in the past. I created a blog site, write one post, and then a few months later, I deleted the site. I did not want to do it this time around. I realize I did not reach my goal of 52 posts, but I also wrote more than I would have had I not set this goal.</p>
<p>I want to keep blogging next year, and beyond. I want to make this a thing that I do. It may not be regular. Blogging makes me think about my writing, how I write. I want to write better. I want to write longer.</p>
<p>2019 is a step forward. I hope it is for you too. Happy 2019!</p>
