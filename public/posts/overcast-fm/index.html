			<p><a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a> is a podcast player that is available on iOS to listen to podcasts. I have been using overcast since 2015 and I have loved it. I stopped using it and switched to the stock Podcasts app on iOS for a minute when I could not get the podcasts on my watch, but then I switched back when watchOS allowed for Overcast to play podcasts directly on the Apple Watch - which is a game changer for me.</p>
<p>There are two features of Overcast that sets it apart from the other podcast players in the market - Smart Speed, and Voice Boost.</p>
<p>The smart speed feature is a time saver. It removes the extra silence between conversations and automatically speeds up and down a podcast episode. People have their own opinions about how this effects the podcast listening experience, but I enjoy smart speed - especially when I am low on listening time and want to be done with the podcast, but do not want to listen to it at 1.5 or 2x speeds.</p>
<p>Voice boost is like an equalizer that amplifies the voice so that the people in the episode sound loud and clear and the music takes a step back. This is particularly helpful when on a train or a bus or in any other noisy environment.</p>
<p><a href="https://marco.org/about">Marco Arment</a> is the creator of the Overcast app. The app is big on Privacy and you do not need to even create an account to use the app. <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Give Overcast a shot</a>!</p>
