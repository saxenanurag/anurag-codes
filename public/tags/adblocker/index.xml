      <description>I use an ad-blocker on my browsers. Its called ad-block plus.
The good part of using an ad-blocker is that it blocks the ads on the sites I visit. It also helps with blocking malware, spam, and cookies that track over websites (you know how when you search for shoes on zappos and then that shoe ad shows up on every website you visit).
The bad part of using an ad-blocker is that there are websites that are solely run, or are majorly dependent on ad revenue.</description>
