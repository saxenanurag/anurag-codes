      <description>At the end of 2017, I decided to make blogging a part of my life of 2018. I decided that I will be writing 52 posts, which is a post a week. And hence, 52 posts in 52 weeks was born.
Itâ€™s the end of 2018 and I published 18 posts (not counting this post). 18 is less than 52, but better than 0.
The year started off with a post a week, but I quickly fell behind.</description>

      <description>You don&amp;rsquo;t have the time or the energy to follow stocks, which ones to invest, which ones to not. When to invest, when to take money out. Instead, invest your money in Index Funds.
There is a saying that a monkey throwing darts on a board with stocks can beat the market. That is because stock performance is difficult to predict. You can predict overall market easier than individual stock market performance.</description>
