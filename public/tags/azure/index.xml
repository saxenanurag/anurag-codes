      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I had to work on a Azure AD SAML integration for a FastAPI application.&#xA;I looked around the internet for a how to and stitched together a solution from&#xA;multiple sources. I am writing this post as a how to on integrating Azure AD SAML&#xA;SSO into a FastAPI application so that there is a single source for others to use.&#xA;I am using PySAML2 and I am sure there are better ways to do this but this is how&#xA;I did it. This integration is written for a FastAPI application but since PySAML2 is&#xA;a library seperate from the Web Framework being used, you could use this as a guide&#xA;to integrate PySAML2 with Flask etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
