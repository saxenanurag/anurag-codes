      <description>At the end of 2017, I decided to make blogging a part of my life of 2018. I decided that I will be writing 52 posts, which is a post a week. And hence, 52 posts in 52 weeks was born.
Itâ€™s the end of 2018 and I published 18 posts (not counting this post). 18 is less than 52, but better than 0.
The year started off with a post a week, but I quickly fell behind.</description>
