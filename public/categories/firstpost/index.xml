      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been wanting to do this for a while - blog. And by a while, I mean for years now. I try, and then I am not so comfortable about it, and things come up, and I give up. It is easy to give up. There is no direct immediate cost to giving up. There are other, easier things to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But why write? Why blog? Well because writing is a means of recording information. It is a means of sharing answers and solutions. It is at times cathartic and therapeutic. I could write all of this in a journal. Sharing in a blog format, hopefully, helps with getting constructive feedback on my ideas and thoughts. It hopefully helps people who may have had a similar issue that I have and find a solution here on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
