      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2017, I decided to make blogging a part of my life of 2018. I decided that I will be writing 52 posts, which is a post a week. And hence, &lt;strong&gt;52 posts in 52 weeks&lt;/strong&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s the end of 2018 and I published &lt;strong&gt;18 posts&lt;/strong&gt; (not counting this post). 18 is less than 52, but better than 0.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The year started off with a post a week, but I quickly fell behind. Part of the reason was motivation, the other is that writing is hard. During this process, I realized that in order to write more, I have to read more. So I started reading more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
