      <description>At the end of 2017, I decided to make blogging a part of my life of 2018. I decided that I will be writing 52 posts, which is a post a week. And hence, 52 posts in 52 weeks was born.
Itâ€™s the end of 2018 and I published 18 posts (not counting this post). 18 is less than 52, but better than 0.
The year started off with a post a week, but I quickly fell behind.</description>

      <description>On August 11, 2018, this tweet went out.
On this day ten years ago, Airbnb launched. pic.twitter.com/UFA7b1weRh
&amp;mdash; Brian Chesky (@bchesky) August 11, 2018  Look at the screenshot. Look how rudimentary the site looks. Yet AirBnb was started. And now its worth a billion dollars.
Dont wait for the right idea to come in your head. Just do it. You will fail. But after failure will come success. Just do it.</description>

  I am not motivated enough to write this week. I am being lazy.
It&#39;s Tuesday. Day 2 of the week. I want to keep on the schedule of writing at least one post a week, but I have not had the chance to work on an article.</description>
