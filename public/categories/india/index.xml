      <description>I love coming to India. It is the country where I am “really from”. It is where I grew up. But, I have not been living here 9 years now, and every time I visit, I see new things. I see how the country is advancing, and I see where it lacks behind.
The smartphone market has exploded in India with everyone holding a smartphone. You can even hail a rickshaw with your phone, which is great - because I hate to haggle on fares.</description>
