      <description>&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t have the time or the energy to follow stocks, which ones to invest, which ones to not. When to invest, when to take money out. Instead, invest your money in Index Funds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a saying that a monkey throwing darts on a board with stocks can beat the market. That is because stock performance is difficult to predict. You can predict overall market easier than individual stock market performance. That is where Index Funds are a better investment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
