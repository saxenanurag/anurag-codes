      <description>Here are the podcasts that I listen to regularly, and recommend to folks who want to listen to something new.&#xA;Up First - NPR - my go to podcast every morning Monday to Friday. Catch up on the top headlines and news for the day in about 13-15 minutes. Freakonomics Radio The Indicator from Planet Money - NPR Pod Save America Radiolab Star Talk Radio - recently started listening to it and loving it.</description>

      <description>Overcast is a podcast player that is available on iOS to listen to podcasts. I have been using overcast since 2015 and I have loved it. I stopped using it and switched to the stock Podcasts app on iOS for a minute when I could not get the podcasts on my watch, but then I switched back when watchOS allowed for Overcast to play podcasts directly on the Apple Watch - which is a game changer for me.</description>
