      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first Macbook was a 2011 Macbook Pro &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.apple.com/kb/SP619?locale=en_US&#34;&gt;(MC700LL/A)&lt;/a&gt;. It came with a 4GB of RAM and 320 GB HDD. After 1.5 years of use, I was able to upgrade the RAM to 8GB and swap out the HDD for a 512 GB SSD. The performance upgrade was life changing. The effort was minimal. Just unscrew the back panel using a precision philips screwdriver and with little knowledge, one can swap out the RAM and HDD/SSD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
