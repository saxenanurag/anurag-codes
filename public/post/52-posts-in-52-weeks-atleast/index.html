        <p>I have been wanting to do this for a while - blog. And by a while, I mean for years now. I try, and then I am not so comfortable about it, and things come up, and I give up. It is easy to give up. There is no direct immediate cost to giving up. There are other, easier things to do.</p>
<p>But why write? Why blog? Well because writing is a means of recording information. It is a means of sharing answers and solutions. It is at times cathartic and therapeutic. I could write all of this in a journal. Sharing in a blog format, hopefully, helps with getting constructive feedback on my ideas and thoughts. It hopefully helps people who may have had a similar issue that I have and find a solution here on this blog.</p>
<p>Writing in a blog will hopefully help me grow professionally as well. <a href="http://andrewchen.co/professional-blogging/">Andrew Chen</a> puts it well - “do it (writing) as a way to send out the “bat signal” on their (your) aspirations, ideas, and interests.”</p>
<p>So for 2018, I have decided to write at least 1 post a week. There may be more than one post in a week. But there will be at least 1 post every week. Setting this goal will help me push for writing more.</p>
<p>I am telling you about this because I want you to hold me accountable. Either vocally - by telling me that I am not doing what I set out to do, or by critiquing my quality of writing, or non-vocally - silently judging my resolve.</p>
<p>But, I am also telling you this because my (distant) hope is that you join me in this journey of writing. Maybe you have been waiting to start writing, but you are hesitant, and this post pushes you to start writing as well. The beauty of the internet is that there is always room for more content. Just because there are people already talking about the topic or the subject you want to talk about does not mean that your opinion, idea, or answer does not have weight. Just start writing! Initially nobody will read your work and thats fine. The key is to get started. #52p52w</p>
<p>I am using posthaven over medium, or blogger, or wordpress, is because of its simplicity. You can read much about posthaven here: <a href="https://posthaven.com/">https://posthaven.com/</a> . It has an easy posting format, lets me use my own domain and I can even email my posts. I don’t have to think about it much. Its simple!</p>
<p>I am excited to get started. I am a little nervous. Hitting that publish button will be cringy but I have to get over it, and the only way to get over the cringe is to write and just publish. If you read this article all the way to the end, I thank you. If you are reading this in 2017, Happy Holidays and I will see you in 2018!
