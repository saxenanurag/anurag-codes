Here are the podcasts that I listen to regularly, and recommend to folks who want to listen to something new.

* [Up First - NPR](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510318/up-first) - my go to podcast every morning Monday to Friday. Catch up on the top headlines and news for the day in about 13-15 minutes.
* [Freakonomics Radio](http://freakonomics.com/)
* [The Indicator from Planet Money - NPR](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money)
* [Pod Save America](https://crooked.com/podcast-series/pod-save-america/)

* [Star Talk Radio](https://www.startalkradio.net/) - recently started listening to it and loving it.
* [Startup Podcast](https://www.gimletmedia.com/startup) - If you do not know about this podcast, I recommend you start with [Season 1](https://www.gimletmedia.com/startup/1-how-not-to-pitch-a-billionaire#episode-player). Season 1 of this podcast is about how to start a podcasting company.
