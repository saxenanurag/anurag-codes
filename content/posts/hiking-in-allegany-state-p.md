Few weeks ago, my wife and I went camping at the Allegany State Park in New York. This is a year round park - meaning that its open all year around for campers and visitors alike.

The park is huge at 64,800 acres. This was our first time here and we enjoyed the stay. Our cabin faced this tiny creek which was beautiful.

Being that this park is also bear country, we had to be mindful of our belongings. We locked our food either in the cabin, or in the car. We never left food outside.

We went on a hike on the [Black Snake Mountain Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/new-york/blacksnake-mountain-trail--2) which was beautiful.

I would definitely be visiting this park again. The cabin, even though primitive, was nice with a gas stove. 3 hours from Cleveland is not a bad drive.

Here are some more pictures from the trip.
